I am Stephan Hirth, a researcher in the field of building physics at the TU Dresden.

**I am interested in topics like:**
- 📉 numerical simulation
- 🏠 building performance simulation such as [SIM-VICUS](https://sim-vicus.de)
- 💻 software developement using Qt + C++ but also python for nice plots and dashboards
- 🌐 webdesign like the [SIM-VICUS](https://sim-vicus.de) webpage using wordpress, but I also like jekyll ;)

You can also find my research papers on [research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephan-Hirth) 

If you have any question feel free to [contact me](mail-to:hirth.stephan@posteo.de)

## 📚 Blog

Check out my [blog](/blog) where I write about topics related to Linux, software development, simulation, and research. I regularly post about interesting problems I solve and knowledge I gain through my work.

## 🌍 ClimateGenerator

I developed [ClimateGenerator](/tabs/ClimateGenerator), a specialized software tool for downloading, processing, and converting meteorological measurement data from the German Weather Service (DWD) into standardized weather files for building and environmental simulations. Learn more about its features and capabilities on the dedicated [project page](/tabs/ClimateGenerator).
