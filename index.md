I am Stephan Hirth, a researcher in the field of building physics at the TU Dresden.

**I am interested in topics like:**
- 📉 numerical simulation
- 🏠 building performance simulation such as [SIM-VICUS](https://sim-vicus.de)
- 💻 software developement using Qt + C++ but also python for nice plots and dashboards
- 🌐 webdesign like the [SIM-VICUS](https://sim-vicus.de) webpage using wordpress, but I also like jekyll ;)

You can also find my research papers on [research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephan-Hirth) 

If you have any question feel free to [contact me](mail-to:hirth.stephan@posteo.de)
