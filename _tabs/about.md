**I am interested in topics like:**
- 📉 numerical simulation
- 🏠 building performance simulation such as [VICUS](https://vicus-software.com)
- 💻 software developement with Qt/C++ for production-ready applications and python for nice plots, dashboards and data-analysis using pandas, matplotlib and/or plotly  
- 🌐 webdesign like the [VICUS](https://vicus-software.com) webpage using wordpress - but now I am moving towards static page-builders like jekyll and Astro

You can also find my research papers on [research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephan-Hirth)
