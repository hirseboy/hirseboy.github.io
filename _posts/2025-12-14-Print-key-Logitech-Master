I ran into the same on Fedora. First make sure you have [Solaar](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Solaar+Ubuntu&cId=0e8caaae-db56-4665-b91b-0ac0416da431&iId=2b20e335-b456-4711-a98d-644b344e806d) installed.

- Then, in Solaar, select the keyboard in the left column.

- In the right column, click the padlock icon for `Key/Button Diversion` until it is unlocked.

- In the dropdown, select `Screenshot` and change `Regular` to `Diverted`.
- Click the padlock icon to lock it again.
- Click the `[Rule Editor](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Solaar+Rule+Editor&cId=e76ca4b8-5628-42dc-b2d8-d3ba13615d62&iId=9c06fc5e-874d-40e1-aa78-57036e7f78d6) ` button in the lower right of Solaar.
- Under `User-defined rules`, right-click to insert a new rule.
- Right-click the new rule, and select `Condition` -> `Key`
- Specify `Screenshot` as the key, keeping `Key down` selected.
- Right-click again, and `Insert below` -> `Action` -> `Key press`
- Specify `Print` as they key

Make sure that the `Key press` action is after / below the `Screenshot (pressed)` condition, and save the changes.

This maps the `Screenshot` key (F7 on my MX Mechanical) to the Print Screen button, and that in turn fires the Ubuntu screenshot tool.

I have noticed that by default, that button emulates a left-shift + opt / start + s key combination, which doesn't do anything on Ubuntu 22.04.
