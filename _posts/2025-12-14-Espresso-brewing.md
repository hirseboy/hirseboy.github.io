# Espresso brewing with a portafilter

I own for some time now a portafilter espresso-machine `ECM Classika I` from the company [ECM](https://www.instagram.com/ecmespresso/?hl=en). Since the process of making a good espresso with different variations of roasted beans (from light roasted fruity beans up to dark roasted chocolaty tasting).

In the article I want to right down my learnings and experiences. 

## brewing-recipes

Depending on the type of beans the brewing recipe can vary a lot. 

| Roast Level | Dose (in) | Yield (out) | Ratio | Time | Temperature | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dark | 18g | 36g | 1:2 | 25-30s | 90-93°C | Classic Italian style, chocolate/nutty notes |
| Medium | 18g | 36-40g | 1:2 - 1:2.2 | 25-30s | 93-94°C | Balanced acidity and sweetness |
| Light | 18-20g | 40-50g | 1:2.2 - 1:2.5 | 30-40s | 94-96°C | Higher yield to extract fruity/floral flavors, often requires finer grind |
